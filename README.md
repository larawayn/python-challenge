# The Python Challenge repository contains two folders for two challenges: PyBank and PyPoll. Each folder contains:
- A new file called main.py. This is the main script to run for each analysis.
- A "Resources" folder that contains the CSV files.
- An "analysis" folder that contains the text file that has the results from the analysis.

# PyBank
- In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. You will give a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. (Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.)
    - The total number of months included in the dataset
    - The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
    - Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes
    - The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
    - The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
- As an example, your analysis should look similar to the one below:
- In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.


# PyPoll
- In this challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process.
- You will be give a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:
    - The total number of votes cast
    - A complete list of candidates who received votes
    - The percentage of votes each candidate won
    - The total number of votes each candidate won
    - The winner of the election based on popular vote.
- In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
